Zen Browser’s **workspaces** feature is your go-to tool for organizing tabs seamlessly by tasks, projects, or themes. Think of each workspace as a focused area where you can group related tabs and quickly switch between sets—ideal for juggling work, personal tasks, or study sessions without cluttering your tab bar.

You can make each workspace your own by adding **default container tabs** to keep accounts or projects isolated within one workspace, preserving privacy and making navigation easy. Customize each workspace with unique icons and names, so it’s a breeze to find what you need.

Perfect for power users, workspaces bring the flexibility of multiple browser windows into one streamlined experience, complete with shortcuts to switch between them in an instant. Organize, focus, and explore your tabs with Zen Browser’s workspaces for a truly efficient browsing experience.
