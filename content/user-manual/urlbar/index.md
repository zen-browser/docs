## Zen URL bar

Zen Browser’s **URL bar** is a powerful tool that helps you navigate the web quickly and efficiently. There's no need to open a new tab or window to search the web—simply type your query into the URL bar and hit Enter to search. The URL bar also supports direct navigation to websites, so you can type a URL and press Enter to visit the site directly.

* Can be disabled in settings or `about:config` (`zen.urlbar.replace-newtab`)

### How does it work?

* When trying to open a new tab, the search bar will appear. This allows you to navigate faster and more efficiently by being able to type out the address or getting auto-completed without having a change in the view.
  * If the newtab urlbar is closed but you've typed something. The text is remembered unless the URL or tab has been changed. 
* Otherwise, the functionality is basically the same as before, only when focusing the urlbar either by clicking on with the shortcut
