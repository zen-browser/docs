Zen Browser’s **profiles** feature is your solution for managing distinct browsing environments all within one browser. Each profile is a fully separate session, with unique cookies, accounts, settings, and history—ideal for keeping work, personal, and project tabs completely isolated.

Switching profiles gives you a “fresh” browsing instance each time, letting you toggle between tasks without crossover. Whether you’re managing multiple accounts or separating personal and professional life, Zen Profiles ensure privacy and streamline your workflow for effortless browsing management.

> [!note]
> If you'd like separate environments inside a single browser instance, try **[[Workspaces + Containers]]** for a flexible, organized setup within the same profile.
