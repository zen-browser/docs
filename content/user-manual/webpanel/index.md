The **Zen Web Panel** brings your favorite web apps—like chats, notes, or to-do lists—right into your browser window for quick, side-by-side multitasking. Instead of switching tabs, you can keep essentials within reach, making it easy to reference or interact without losing focus on your main task.

With options to float or pin these panels alongside your browsing tabs, the Sidebar is perfect for keeping tools like messaging or music accessible. Planned upgrades will even add notification badges for real-time updates, creating a streamlined and productive workspace within Zen.
