# Performance Benchmarks ðŸ“Š

Welcome to Zen Browser's performance benchmarks! Here you'll find comprehensive testing data showing how Zen Browser compares to other popular browsers in terms of speed, memory usage, and overall performance.

<Callout type="info" title="Testing Methodology">
All benchmarks are conducted using industry-standard tools like **Speedometer 3.0** and **WebXPRT 4** to ensure accurate and comparable results across different browsers.
</Callout>

## Browser Speed Comparison

### Speedometer 3.0 Results

Speedometer 3.0 is a browser benchmark that simulates real-world user interactions to measure web application responsiveness. Higher scores indicate better performance.

| Browser | Windows Score | macOS Score | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| **Chrome** | 22.5 | 29.2 | Industry standard for speed |
| **Safari** | N/A | 39.1 | macOS exclusive, fastest overall |
| **Brave** | 20.2 | 28.7 | Privacy-focused Chromium fork |
| **Firefox** | 18.1 | 33.9 | Strong macOS performance |
| **Zen Browser** | 17.2 | 32.5 | Firefox-based with UI enhancements |
| **Arc** | 20.8 | 22.5 | Unique UI approach |
| **Edge** | 17.6 | 25.9 | Microsoft's Chromium browser |
| **Opera** | 19.7 | 29.4 | Feature-rich browser |
| **Vivaldi** | 19.5 | 28.0 | Highly customizable |

### Key Performance Insights

<Callout type="none" title="Platform Performance">
**macOS Performance**: Browsers generally perform significantly better on macOS than Windows. Zen Browser scores **32.5** on macOS compared to **17.2** on Windows.

**Firefox-Based Performance**: As a Firefox-based browser, Zen inherits Firefox's performance characteristics, which tend to be stronger on macOS platforms.

## Memory Usage Analysis

Memory efficiency is crucial for a smooth browsing experience, especially when working with multiple tabs.

### RAM Usage Comparison
*After 3 hours of normal browsing (8-9 tabs, YouTube, Slack, Gmail)*

| Browser | Estimated RAM Usage | Memory Efficiency |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Safari** | ~800MB | Excellent |
| **Zen Browser** | ~1.2GB | Good |
| **Firefox** | ~1.3GB | Good |
| **Chrome** | ~1.8GB | Moderate |
| **Brave** | ~1.6GB | Moderate |
| **Edge** | ~1.5GB | Moderate |

- **Memory Efficient**: Better RAM usage than Chromium-based alternatives
- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux

### Performance Trade-offs

<Callout type="warn" title="Performance Considerations">
- **Speed**: Zen Browser is slightly slower than Chromium-based browsers in synthetic benchmarks
- **Web Compatibility**: Occasional compatibility issues with Chrome-optimized websites
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Smaller extension library compared to Chrome Web Store
</Callout>

## Testing Environment

All benchmarks were conducted under controlled conditions:

- **Hardware**: Modern systems with 16GB+ RAM
- **Testing Mode**: Private/Incognito browsing
- **Extensions**: Minimal extensions (uBlock Origin where applicable)
- **Network**: Stable broadband connection
- **Multiple Runs**: Each test run 3 times, best score recorded

## Benchmark Tools Used

- **Speedometer 3.0**: Web application responsiveness
- **WebXPRT 4**: Real-world web performance scenarios
- **Memory Monitoring**: Activity Monitor (macOS) / Task Manager (Windows)

## Performance Optimization Tips

<Callout type="info" title="Maximize Zen Browser Performance">
For optimal Zen Browser performance:

- **Keep extensions minimal**: Only install necessary extensions
- **Regular maintenance**: Clear cache and cookies periodically
- **Hardware acceleration**: Enable in Settings â†’ General â†’ Performance
- **Tab management**: Close unused tabs and organize with workspaces
- **Update regularly**: Keep Zen Browser updated to the latest version
</Callout>

## Community Benchmarks

The Zen Browser community regularly conducts independent performance tests. Recent community findings include:

- **Startup time**: Zen Browser typically starts 15-20% faster than vanilla Firefox
- **Tab switching**: Vertical tab design improves navigation efficiency by 30%
- **Memory per tab**: Average 45MB per tab vs 65MB for Chrome-based browsers

## Future Performance Goals

The Zen Browser team is actively working on performance improvements:

- **WebRender optimization**: Enhanced GPU acceleration for better rendering
- **Process isolation**: Improved security and stability through better process management
- **JavaScript engine**: Leveraging latest SpiderMonkey improvements from Firefox
- **Resource management**: Better handling of system resources and battery life

## Conclusion

While Zen Browser may not top the raw speed charts, it offers a compelling balance of **performance, privacy, and customization**. For users who prioritize a clean interface, strong privacy features, and efficient memory usage over absolute speed, Zen Browser provides excellent value.

The performance gap between Zen and faster browsers is often negligible in real-world usage, while the benefits of enhanced privacy, customization, and user experience make it an attractive choice for privacy-conscious users.
