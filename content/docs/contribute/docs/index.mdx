description: Getting started with contributing to the documentation for Zen Browser.
---

This guide will help you get started with contributing to the documentation for Zen Browser. The documentation is crucial for helping users and developers understand and use the project effectively. We use Fumadocs for generating the static documentation site.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system to clone the repository and manage your code.
- [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/): Required for building the NextJS site.
- [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node package manager, which comes with Node.js.
- [**IDE of your choice**](/contribute/docs/editing-with-vscode): You can use any text editor or IDE of your choice.

## 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to the [Zen Browser Documentation Repository](https://github.com/zen-browser/docs).
2. Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page to create a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## 2. Clone the Repository

Once you have forked the repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docs.git
cd docs
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

## 3. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command installs all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

## 4. Open the Project in IDE

Open the cloned repository folder in your IDE to begin editing. If you're using Visual Studio Code, check out our [VS Code setup guide](/contribute/docs/editing-with-vscode) for detailed instructions.

1. Open IDE.
2. Select "Open Folder" or "File > Open Folder".
3. Navigate to the cloned repository folder.

## 5. Make Your Changes

You can now start editing the documentation. The project structure is as follows:

- **`content/docs/`** - contains the Markdown files for the documentation.
- **`public/assets/`** - contains images and other static assets used in the documentation.
- _**`src/`** - contains the source code for the documentation site. No changes are required here._

### Writing Guidelines

- Follow the existing structure and formatting conventions.
- Use clear and concise language.
- Include examples and code snippets where applicable.
- Ensure all links and references are accurate.

## 6. Preview the Documentation

To preview the documentation site locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This command starts a local server running on `http://localhost:3000` that you can access from your browser. The site will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the Markdown files.

## 7. Check the Build

Before committing your changes, ensure the documentation site builds successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will build the static site. If there are any errors, fix them before proceeding.

## 8. Commit and Push Your Changes

Once you are satisfied with your changes, commit them to your local repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

Push your changes to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 9. Create a Pull Request

After pushing your changes, go to the original Zen Browser Documentation Repository and submit a pull request:

1. Navigate to the repository you forked from.
2. Click on the "Pull Requests" tab.
3. Click on "New Pull Request" and select your branch.
4. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes.
5. Submit the pull request.

Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers, and you may be asked to make some adjustments. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main branch.
