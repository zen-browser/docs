title: Memory Debugging
description: This document explains how to properly diagnose and report memory issues in Zen Browser.
---
## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do not use Task Manager** — its memory readings may be inaccurate.
- Use one of the following instead:
  - **Shift + Esc** or `about:processes` — shows memory usage for **tabs, extensions, and the GPU process**
    - *(Other processes are usually not relevant.)*
  - `about:memory` → **Measure and Save** — generates a detailed memory report
- If you need help, upload the memory report to:
  - GitHub Issues
  - Zen Discord support channel

---

## ✅ Troubleshooting Steps

1. Open `about:profiles`
2. Click **Create a New Profile**
3. Compare memory usage between:
   - Your **main profile**
   - The **new clean profile**
4. If the new profile does **not** show memory issues:
   - The problem may be caused by extensions, mods, themes, or user configuration
   - Try disabling or removing them and retest
5. If the new profile **still** shows high memory usage:
   - The issue may be internal to Zen
   - Collect a memory report and **open an issue** with details

## 📝 When Reporting an Issue, Include:

- Operating system + version
- Zen Browser version
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Memory report from `about:memory`
- Whether the issue occurs in a fresh profile
