description: How to integrate 1Password Desktop App with Zen Browser
---

This guide is designed to help you integrate [1Password Desktop App](https://1password.com/downloads) with Zen Browser for a more **straightforward workflow** when accessing your credentials using this password manager browser extension.

<Callout type="warn">
This guide only applies to **Linux** and **macOS** users.

**Windows** users should use the 1Password browser extension without integration with the desktop app.

See this page for more info: [Adding another trusted browser - 1Password](https://support.1password.com/1password-browser-connection-security/#adding-another-trusted-browser).

1Password browser integrations rely on a [list of recognized and trusted browsers](https://support.1password.com/1password-browser-connection-security/). Through this integration, account information and encryption keys are securely transferred, enabling the 1Password app and browser extension to share vaults, sync lock status, and unlock the Browser Extension Vault using biometric authentication.

Since Zen Browser is still under development and [under the usage threshold](https://1password.community/discussion/comment/719323#Comment_719341), it isnâ€™t included in this list. As a result, the 1Password browser integration does not work with Zen Browser.

## Workarounds

That being said, there are workaround methods to add Zen Browser to the _Trusted Browsers_ list for **Linux** and **MacOS**.

### Linux

You can create a _Custom Allowed Browsers_ file that 1Password will use to allow Zen Browser -- or other non-officially supported browsers -- to integrate with 1Password's desktop app.

#### 1. Create 1Password's config directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/1password
```

#### 2. Create the Custom Allowed Browsers file

```bash
sudo touch /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers
```

#### 3. Add Zen Browser to this custom list

```bash
echo "zen-bin" | sudo tee -a /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers
```

### macOS

In macOS, you can manually add Zen Browser to the trusted browsers list in the 1Password app.

1. Go into the 1Password desktop app and open Settings.

2. In the Browser tab, click "Add Browser".

3. In your Applications folder, find and add "Zen Browser", then authorize 1Password when prompted.
