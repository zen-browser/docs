description: How to integrate 1Password Desktop App with Zen Browser
---

This Guide is designed to help you integrate [1Password Desktop App](https://1password.com/downloads) with Zen Browser, for a more **straight forward workflow** when accessing your credentials using this password manager browser extension.

<Callout type="warn">
This guide only applies for **Linux** and **MacOS** users.

**Windows** users can still use the Browser Extension without integration with the Desktop App

See: [Adding another trusted browser - 1Password](https://support.1password.com/1password-browser-connection-security/#adding-another-trusted-browser)

1Password browser integrations follows a [list of well-known/trusted browser](https://support.1password.com/1password-browser-connection-security/), with this integration account information and encryption keys are transferred using this connection to allow the 1Password app and browser extension to share your vaults and lock state and allowing you to unlock your Browser Extension Vault with [bio-metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics) data.

Since Zen Browser is still under development and [under the usage threshold](https://1password.community/discussion/comment/719323#Comment_719341) 1Password takes in consideration Zen Browser is not within this list causing the 1Password Browser integration to fail.

## Workarounds

That being said, there are workaround methods to add Zen Browser to this _Trusted Browsers_ list for **Linux** and **MacOS**.

### Linux

You can create a _Custom Allowed Browsers_ file that 1Password will use to allow Zen Browser -- or other non-officially supported browser-- to integrate with 1Password's desktop app.

#### 1. Create 1Password's config directory

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/1password
```

#### 2. Create the Custom Allowed Browsers file

```bash
sudo touch /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers
```

#### 3. Add Zen Browser to this custom list

```bash
echo "zen-bin" | sudo tee -a /etc/1password/custom_allowed_browsers
```

1. Go into the 1Password desktop app and open Settings.

2. In the Browser tab, click "Add Browser".

3. In your Applications folder, find and add "Zen Browser", then authorize 1Password when prompted.
