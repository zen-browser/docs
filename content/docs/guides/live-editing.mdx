This Guide will help you customize the appearance of Zen Browser by live editing the `userChrome.css` file. Follow the steps below to start customizing your browser's theme.

## Step 1: Access the Profile Folder

<Callout type="warn">
  On the Flatpak version of Zen, the profile folder will be located at `~/.var/app/app.zen_browser.zen/.zen`.
</Callout>

1. Open Zen Browser.
2. Type `about:support` in the address bar and press Enter.
3. Look for the **Application Basics** section.
4. Click on **Open Profile Folder**. This will open the folder where Zen Browser stores your user data.

## Step 2: Create the `chrome` Folder

1. In the Profile Folder, create a new folder and name it `chrome`.
2. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new blank file named `userChrome.css`.
3. Restart Zen Browser to apply the changes.

## Step 3: Open Style Editor in Zen Browser

<Callout type="warn" title="How do I enable the Browser Developer Tools?">
  After Zen Browser version `1.0.0-a.31` the Browser Developer Tools is <strong>disabled</strong> by default for security.
  
  1. Open the `about:config` page. This page contains advanced settings for the browser.
  2. Search for `devtools.debugger.remote-enabled` and toggle it to `true`.
  3. Search for `devtools.chrome.enabled` and toggle it to `true`.
</Callout>

1. In Zen Browser, press <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Shift + Alt + I" /> to open the Developer Tools.
2. Navigate to the **Style Editor** tab.
3. In the filter/search bar, type `userChrome` to locate the `userChrome.css` file you created earlier.

## Step 4: Edit the `userChrome.css` File

<Callout type="warn">
  If a style does not apply as expected, try adding the `!important` keyword at the end of the CSS rule. This forces the browser to apply the style regardless of any other existing styles.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  If you wish to edit pop-ups or menus that automatically hide, be sure to enable the `Disable Popup Auto-Hide` option from the <em>Browser Toolbox</em> settings menu ( â‹¯ button )
</Callout>

1. The `userChrome.css` file should now be visible in the Style Editor.
2. You can start editing the file directly within the Style Editor.
   ![inspect button](/assets/live-editing/inspect.png)
   - **Note:** You can use the **Inspect** button to hover over and select elements on the page. This allows you to learn about the `id`, `class`, or other attributes of elements, which you can then target in your `userChrome.css` file.
3. To apply your changes, save the file by clicking **Save** or by pressing <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + S" />.

Any changes you make to the `userChrome.css` file will be applied immediately to Zen Browser.
Use this file to customize various UI elements, such as colors, fonts, and the layout.
