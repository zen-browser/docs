## Security

<Callout type="info" title="Latest Firefox Version">
Zen Browser is built on the **latest version of Firefox**, one of the most secure browsers available today. This means you benefit from all of Firefox's security patches and updates as soon as they are released, keeping you safe from known vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

### 1. Staying Up-to-Date with Firefox

Zen Browser tracks Firefox updates very closely:

- We update Zen to the latest Firefox release within **0â€“72 hours** so we can always stay up to date with security fixes.
- We test upcoming versions using Firefox **RC builds** on the *Twilight* branch about **one week before** each official release.

You can check which Firefox version Zen is currently based on here:

### 2. OCSP Enabled

Zen Browser uses **OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol)** to check the validity of a websiteâ€™s security certificate. This ensures that you only connect to safe websites with up-to-date and valid certificates, protecting you from malicious sites that may have expired or revoked certificates.

### 3. HTTPS Only Mode

**HTTPS Only Mode** ensures that you connect securely to websites by using the HTTPS version whenever possible. HTTPS encrypts the communication between you and the website, protecting your data from being intercepted by hackers.

<Callout type="info">
You can enable HTTPS-Only Mode inÂ **all windows**Â orÂ **private windows only**.
</Callout>

### 4. Deceptive Content and Dangerous Software Protection

Zen Browser helps protect you from **phishing, malware, and fraudulent websites**. It uses URL filters and real-time checks to block harmful content, making your browsing experience safer.

### 5. SSL â€“ Treat Unsafe Negotiation as Broken by Default

Zen Browser treats insecure SSL connections (those that don't meet modern security standards) as broken by default. This means that if a **website is not properly secured**, Zen Browser will alert you and **block the unsafe connection**, preventing potential security risks.

## Privacy settings

### 1. Tracking Protection

To protect your privacy, Zen Browser includes **tracking protection**. This feature automatically blocks websites and advertisers from tracking your online activity, making it harder for third parties to collect your data and show you targeted ads.

<Callout type="info">
You can choose from three levels of Tracking Protection: **Standard**, **Strict**, or **Custom**.
</Callout>

### 2. DNS over HTTPS

Zen Browser allows the users to enable DNS over HTTPS, which **sends your request for a domain name through an encrypted connection**, providing a secure DNS and making it harder for others to see which website youâ€™re about to access.

<Callout type="info">
You can choose from three protection levels: **Default Protection**, **Increased Protection**, or **Max Protection**.
</Callout>

These security features work behind the scenes to provide a safe and private browsing experience. With Zen Browser, you can browse with confidence knowing that your security is always a top priority.
