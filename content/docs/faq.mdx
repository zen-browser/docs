## How can I use horizontal tabs?

Zen Browser will not support horizontal tabs in the near future. The decision to focus on **Vertical Tabs** is a core design choice, with the entire Zen Browser experience built around this concept. This approach is intended to maximize screen space and improve navigation, making vertical tabs an essential part of Zen's philosophy.

## Will there be mobile version for Zen Browser?

At the moment, our team does not have the time or resources to develop Android or iOS versions of Zen Browser. Additionally, we believe that Zen’s unique features, particularly its design around vertical tabs, do not translate well to the mobile form factor. As such, we do not currently have plans to develop a mobile version of Zen Browser.

## Why can't Zen Browser play DRM-protected content?

<Callout type="warn">
  This only affects Microsoft Windows and MacOS
</Callout>

<Callout type="none" title="What is DRM?">
  [Digital Rights Management](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM) is a technology used to control how digital content, such as videos and music, can be accessed and used. DRM is commonly used by streaming services to protect copyrighted content. When you try to play DRM-protected content, the website verifies if the necessary DRM software is available on your browser. Most browsers use [**Widevine**](https://www.widevine.com), a DRM technology developed by Google, to facilitate this.
</Callout>

Zen Browser currently lacks DRM-support, because it does not have a Widevine license. Acquiring such a license requires the payment of large fees (at least $5,000). Acquiring this license is financially unresponsible for the developer of Zen. This means that DRM-protected media cannot be played in Zen Browser for the foreseeable future.
We have to also consider that in order to be able to apply for this license, Zen must be a part of a company with size at least as big as Mozilla or Brave.

<Callout type="none" title="Which Services Are Affected?">
  Due to the lack of DRM support, you will not be able to stream content from the following services in Zen Browser:
  
  - **HBO Max**
  - **Netflix**
  - **Spotify**
  - **Disney+**
  - **Amazon Prime Video**
  - **Apple Music**
  - **Google Play Movies & TV**
  - **And possible other services that use DRM not listed here**
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Alternative solutions">
  - Use a browser that has a Widevine license, such as [**Mozilla Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), when streaming DRM-protected content.
  - Use the native desktop app for the service you want to use
</Callout>

## How do I know Zen is safe?

Zen Browser is designed with a focus on security and privacy. Additionally, the browser's codebase is derived from Firefox, a well-known and trusted open-source project. Users can verify the safety of the browser by reviewing the source code available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop). Regular updates and community engagement also contribute to its security.

3. Change the view mode by pressing the `[|]` button in the top address bar

## How to switch tabs by scrolling?

You can enable this feature by changing a setting in the browser's configuration. Here's how:

1. Open the `about:config` page. This page contains advanced settings for the browser.
2. Search for `toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling`
3. Toggle the setting to `true` by double-clicking on it

Once this setting is enabled, you can hover your mouse over the tab bar and use your mouse wheel to scroll through the tabs, making it easier to navigate between them.

## Where do report problems and bugs?

<Callout type="info">
New features are not bugs. Please see [Where do I recommend features?](#where-do-i-recommend-features) below
</Callout>

If you want report an issue or a bug with the browser, you can do so on the browser's GitHub page. Before submitting your request, it's mandatory to check if the issue has already been reported. You can do this by searching through existing issues on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues).

Keep in mind that the Zen Browser team is currently very small, so it might take some time for your request to be reviewed and addressed. The team is dedicated to improving the browser, but with limited resources, they prioritize the most critical and popular requests. Your patience and thoroughness in reporting can help make Zen Browser better for everyone.

## Where do I recommend features?

If you want to recommend features or new ideas for Zen, you can do so on the GitHub discussion page. Before submitting your request, it's mandatory to check if the issue or feature has already been reported. You can do this by searching through existing issues on the [GitHub discussions page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/discussions).

It may also be a good idea to see the [Zen Browser Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen_browser/) where there are active discussions of development. Please remember again that the team is small and always in need of help so if you can't find a way to develop the new feature yourself, it will only come once someone is available and has enough interest to build it. Careful descriptions and explanation of the point of the feature may help.

## How can I sync my data across multiple devices?
