Welcome to the FAQs section! Here, you'll find answers to common questions and helpful tips to enhance your experience with Zen Browser. If your question isn't covered here, feel free to explore our subreddit, [r/zen_browser](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen_browser), or reach out to the support team.

## How can I use horizontal tabs?

Zen Browser will not support horizontal tabs in the near future. The decision to focus on **Vertical Tabs** is a core design choice; the entire Zen Browser experience is built around them. Vertical tabs are intended to maximize screen space and improve navigation, and they are an essential part of Zen's philosophy.

## Will there be mobile version for Zen Browser?

At the moment, our team does not have the time or resources to develop Android or iOS versions of Zen Browser. Additionally, we believe that Zen’s unique features, particularly its design around vertical tabs, do not translate well to the mobile form factor. As such, we do not currently have plans to develop a mobile version of Zen Browser.

## Why can't Zen Browser play DRM-protected content?

<Callout type="warn">
  This issue only affects Microsoft Windows and MacOS.
</Callout>

<Callout type="none" title="What is DRM?">
  [Digital Rights Management](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM) is a technology used to control how digital content, such as videos and music, can be accessed and used. DRM is commonly used by streaming services to protect copyrighted content. When you try to play DRM-protected content, the website verifies if the necessary DRM software is available on your browser. Most browsers use [**Widevine**](https://www.widevine.com), a DRM technology developed by Google, to facilitate this.
</Callout>

Zen Browser currently lacks DRM support, as it does not yet have a Widevine license. This means DRM-protected media cannot be played in Zen Browser for the foreseeable future.

We’re in the process of obtaining a Widevine license and are currently awaiting approval from Google. If you’d like to help speed things along, you can express your support by contacting Google directly through their [Widevine contact form](https://www.widevine.com/contact).


<Callout type="none" title="Which services are affected?">
  Due to the lack of DRM support, you will not be able to stream content from the following services in Zen Browser:
  
  - **HBO Max**
  - **Netflix**
  - **Spotify**
  - **Disney+**
  - **Amazon Prime Video**
  - **Apple Music**
  - **Google Play Movies & TV**
  - **Other services that require DRM**
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Alternative solutions">
  - Use a browser that has a Widevine license, such as [**Mozilla Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), when streaming DRM-protected content.
  - Use the native desktop app for the service you want to use
</Callout>

## How do I know Zen is safe?

Zen Browser is designed with a focus on security and privacy. The browser's codebase is derived from Firefox, a well-known and trusted open-source project. Additionally, users can verify the safety of Zen by reviewing its source code, whcih is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop). Regular updates and community engagement also contribute to its security.

## How do I use the Split View feature?

<Callout type="info" title="Tip">
  Use shortcuts to perform Split View actions faster!
</Callout>

1. **Select multiple tabs by left-clicking them while holding the <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl" /> key, or left-click 2 tabs while holding the <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift" /> key to select all tabs in between.**
2. **Right click a tab, and select `Split x Tabs`.**
3. **Change the view mode by pressing the `[|]` button in the top address bar.**

## How to switch tabs by scrolling?

You can enable this feature by changing a setting in the browser's configuration. Here's how:

1. **Type `about:config` into your address bar.**
2. **Search for `toolkit.tabbox.switchByScrolling`.**
3. **Double-click the flag in order to toggle it to `true`.**

Once this setting is enabled, you can hover your mouse over the tab bar and use your mouse wheel to scroll through the tabs, making it easier to navigate between them.

## Where do I report problems and bugs?

<Callout type="info">
  Lack of a certain feature is not a bug. Please see the [Where do I recommend features?](#where-do-i-recommend-features) section below.
</Callout>

If you want report an issue or a bug with Zen, you can do so by creating a new GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues). Before submitting your request, you must check if the issue has already been reported. You can do so by searching through existing issues on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/issues).

Keep in mind that the Zen Browser team is currently very small, so it might take some time for your request to be reviewed and addressed. The Zen team is dedicated to improving the browser, but due to limited resources, the team prioritizes the most critical and popular requests. Your patience and thoroughness in reporting can help make Zen Browser better for everyone.

## Where do I recommend features?

If you want to recommend new features or ideas for Zen, you can do so on [Zen's GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/discussions).

You may also be interested in exploring the [Zen Browser subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/zen_browser/), where there are active discussions regarding Zen's development. Please remember that the Zen team is small and always in need of help, so unless you can develop the new feature yourself, it will only come once someone is available and has enough interest to build it. Careful descriptions and explanation of the point of the feature may help.

## How can I sync my data across multiple devices?

Zen Browser integrates with Firefox Sync, allowing you to sync your addons, bookmarks, history, passwords, and other browser data across multiple devices. To enable Firefox Sync in Zen Browser:

2. Open the folder of the profile you are currently using (usually, the one with the (release) suffix).
