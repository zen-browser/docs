Extensions are a small software piece that enhance and personalize a browser by adding or modifying browser function and features. Example of commonly installed extensions includes ad blockers, easy reader mode, privacy and tracking managers, media downloaders, password managers, and tweaks for commonly used websites.

Since Zen is based on Mozilla Firefox, you can install extensions from the same source: https://addons.mozilla.org.

<Callout> Due to fundamental difference on how Zen does theming, Firefox themes are not supported in Zen. </Callout>

<Callout title="Difference between Extensions and Zen Mods"> Extensions are made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. Depending on the permissions you enabled when installing, extensions generally affect websites you visit. Meanwhile, Zen Mods are made with CSS and only affect the browser UI. </Callout>


### Manage Extensions using Extensions Button
When you launch Zen, there will be an Extension button (with jigsaw icon) in the top bar. It will show a list of enabled extensions, where you can see which permissions the extensions have for the site you're visiting. You can click the gear icon beside each extensions to perform some common actions like Pin to Toolbar, Manage Extension to access extension settings, Remove Extension, or [Report Extension to Mozilla](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/reporting-extensions-and-themes-abuse).
