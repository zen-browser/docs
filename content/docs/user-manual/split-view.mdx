Zen's Split View lets you view up to 4 tabs side by side, so you can compare information or multitask easily.

### Creating split view
You can create split view simply by open one tab, drag another tab from sidebar to left or right side of it, and drop once the split indicator placeholder is shown. You can also right click on a link and choose `"Split link in new tab"`.

{ /* TODO: insert video of these sequences:
- dragging a tab to split it with another tab
- click new tab button, insert url, load it, and drag it into the existing split.
- right click a link from one of the tabs > click "split link in new tab"
*/}

### Using split view
When split view is enabled, the active tab will have an overlay on its top side, containing two buttons: **Drag Handle** `:::` button and **Unsplit Tab** `‒` button. 

{ /* TODO: `insert gif/video of dragging split tab and then pressing ‒ button to unsplit it` */}

- With **Drag Handle** `:::` button, you can move a split tab to various directions (left, bottom, right, or top side of another tabs). 
- Meanwhile, clicking **Unsplit Tab** `‒` button will remove the tab and expand it outside the previous split view.
- Currently, you can **unsplit all tabs within a split view** by pressing `Alt + Ctrl/Cmd + U` shortcut.

### Toggle Split View shortcuts

Zen also provide keyboard shortcuts to help you rearrange the split tabs automatically into a horizontal, vertical, or grid layout.

- **Toggle Split View Horizontal**: `Alt + Ctrl/Cmd + H`
- **Toggle Split View Vertical**: `Alt + Ctrl/Cmd + V`
- **Toggle Split View Grid**: `Alt + Ctrl/Cmd + G`

{ /* TODO: insert gif/video of horizontal, vertical, and grid toggling split view here */}

You can also press one of the Toggle Split View shortcuts to split current tab with the tab below it.

All shortcuts can be modified via `Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts`.
