Zen's Split View lets you view up to 4 tabs side by side, so you can compare information or multitask easily.

### Creating split view

There are 5 ways of creating a split view:

#### Drag the tab

You can create split view simply by open one tab, drag another tab from sidebar to left or right side of it, and drop once the split indicator placeholder is shown. If this functionality gets in your way you can disable it through the `zen.splitView.enable-tab-drop` [hidden preference](/guides/about-config-flags#zensplitviewenable-tab-drop).

#### Right-click menu

You can also (1) right click on a link and (2) choose `"Split link in new tab"`.

{ /* TODO: insert video of these sequences:
- dragging a tab to split it with another tab
- click new tab button, insert url, load it, and drag it into the existing split.
- right click a link from one of the tabs > click "split link in new tab"
*/}

#### Multi-selection and tab menu

From the side bar, you can select 1 or more tabs with <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Click"/> then right-click one of the selected tabs and select the option `"Split X Tabs"`.

#### Multi-selection and shortcut

Like the previous method you can also select the tabs you wish to split but rather than using the right-click menu, you can use the `"Toggle Split View <Direction>"` shortcuts which can be found in your `preferences`. The defaults are listed in [Split View shortcuts](#split-view-shortcuts)

#### Creating a new tab as a Split View

From an existing open tab you can use the <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift + Ctrl + ="/> shortcut (or <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift + Ctrl + 8"/> depending on your system) to create a new tab as a split view.

<Callout>
This shortcut only works to create a 2-paned split view, additional panes need to be added with the other methods.

### Using split view
When split view is enabled, the active tab will have an overlay on its top side, containing two buttons: **Drag Handle** `:::` button and **Unsplit Tab** `‒` button. 

{ /* TODO: `insert gif/video of dragging split tab and then pressing ‒ button to unsplit it` */}

- With **Drag Handle** `:::` button, you can move a split tab to various directions (left, bottom, right, or top side of another tabs). 
- Meanwhile, clicking **Unsplit Tab** `‒` button will remove the tab and expand it outside the previous split view.
- Currently, you can **unsplit all tabs within a split view** by pressing <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + Ctrl + U" /> shortcut.

### Split View shortcuts

Zen also provides keyboard shortcuts to help you rearrange the split tabs automatically into a horizontal, vertical, or grid layout.

- **Toggle Split View Horizontal**: <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + Ctrl + H" />
- **Toggle Split View Vertical**: <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + Ctrl + V" />
- **Toggle Split View Grid**: <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + Ctrl + G" />
- **New Empty Split View**: <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift + Ctrl + 8"/> on Linux/MacOS / <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift + Ctrl + ="/> on Windows 

{ /* TODO: insert gif/video of horizontal, vertical, and grid toggling split view here */}

You can also press one of the Toggle Split View shortcuts to split the current tab with the tab below it.

<Callout>
All shortcuts can be modified via `Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts`.
</Callout>

<Callout>
The shortcuts only work to initiate a split view, they can not be used to directly add more tabs to the existing view unless you select additional tabs including the split from the side bar.
