Zen now **syncs windows on the same device**, so changes in one window are reflected across the others instantly. Creating new window will automatically start at your existing Space, showing all of your existing tabs. If you're opening two window and clicking on the same tab, the inactive window will show dimmed preview of the website.

}

If you open multiple windows of Zen, when you close them using "Quit" option from main menu or <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Q" /> shortcut, Zen will save the state of your windows. When you reopen Zen afterwards, the multiple windows will be restored. No more tab loss! 

## New Blank Window option
You can also create blank windows as alternative to synced new windows. **New Blank Window** option is available from the main menu, and can be accessed using <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Alt + N" /> (<KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + N" /> for Windows; keyboard shortcut can be configured from Settings). Blank windows will inherit cookies and container from the origin Space, and sites you visit in blank windows will also be written to your history. For example, when you're creating blank window from a Space with Banking container, the new blank window will have Banking container for its tabs as default.

When you're done browsing on a blank window, you can click the **Move To...** button (above your tab list) to move and sync the tabs back to an existing Space.

## Recovering Lost Window Sessions

Since Zen 1.18b, alongside the Window Sync feature, Zen provides new session backup system that saved tab state of all synced windows regularly, including when you're moving tabs or change status of a tab (essentials, pinned, unpinned, and/or splitted). This improves accuracy of session restoring by Zen. It will also makes it easier for you to do manual session restoration if you lose tabs from a session. Follow these steps to restore:

- Make sure Zen is closed.
- Open root directory of your current Zen profile (Open `about:support` in Zen, navigate to **Applications Basics** section, find **Profile Directory**, and click **Open Directory** button.)
  - On the Flatpak version of Zen, the profile root directory will be located at `~/.var/app/app.zen_browser.zen/.zen`.
- Open the `zen-sessions-backup` folder, you will see multiple backup files in .jsonlz4 format:

- Duplicate the latest zen-sessions-`date-hour`.jsonlz4 file, rename it to **zen-sessions.jsonlz4**.
- Copy **zen-sessions.jsonlz4** to your profile root directory.
- Open Zen again and tabs from the session backup will be restored.

<Callout type="info" title="Can we sync Zen tabs and windows across devices?">
    The current window sync only works on the same device, but multi-device sync support is planned. For now, you can use the **Send to Device** option to send tabs between devices that logged in to the same Mozilla account.
