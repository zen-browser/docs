Zen now **syncs windows on the same device**, so changes in one window are reflected across the others instantly. Creating new window will automatically start at your existing Space, showing all of your existing tabs. If you're opening two window and clicking on the same tab, the inactive window will show dimmed preview of the website.

}

Some things to note, to improve your experience with Zen window sync:
- After opening new Zen window, you can **create new Space** to start fresh while keeping easy access to Essential tabs. The Space will persist upon restarts. 
- Use multiple Spaces to separate tabs for specific browsing tasks. Freely create or delete them based on your needs.

<summary>You can also use **New blank window** option from the main menu or <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Shift + N" />. The window will inherit container and cookies from your original Space, with a **Move to..** button to easily move the tabs back to one of your existing Spaces. Tabs in blank window are temporary and won't be restored upon restarts.</summary>

- If you use multiple windows regularly, use **Quit** option from main menu or <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Q" /> shortcut to quit the browser. Zen will save the state of all your open windows and restore them properly upon reopening.

### Updating from Zen v1.17.15 or older

</details>

- **Duplicate the latest file**. This could be recovery.jsonlz4 or one of the upgrade.jsonlz4-`date-metadata`.
- Rename it to **sessionstore.jsonlz4**.
- Copy the sessionstore.jsonlz4 file to the root directory (one folder above).
- Open Zen and the tabs should be restored.
- If failed, close Zen and retry the steps with another backup files from sessionstore-backups folder. 

### Zen v1.18+ session backup system

Alongside Window Sync, Zen provides new session backup system that regularly saved tab state of all synced windows, including changes to their status (essentials, pinning, split view). This significantly improves the accuracy of session restoration by Zen and facilitates manual restoration if tabs are lost. Follow these steps to restore:

- Navigate to root directory of your Zen profile.
- **Make sure Zen is fully closed.**

<details>

<summary>Open the `zen-sessions-backup` folder. You will see multiple backup files in .jsonlz4 format:</summary>

</details>

- Duplicate the latest zen-sessions-`date-hour`.jsonlz4 file, rename it to **zen-sessions.jsonlz4**.
- Copy **zen-sessions.jsonlz4** to your profile root directory.
- Open Zen again and tabs from the session backup will be restored.

<Callout type="info" title="Can we sync Zen tabs and windows across devices?">
    The current window sync only works on the same device, but multi-device sync support is planned. For now, you can use the **Send to Device** option to send tabs between devices that logged in to the same Mozilla account.
