import KeyboardShortcut from '@/components/KeyboardShortcut';

Zen now **syncs windows on the same device**, so changes in one window are reflected across the others instantly. Creating a new window will automatically start at your current Space, showing all of your existing tabs. If you're opening two windows and clicking on the same tab, the inactive window will show a dimmed preview of the website.

}

Zen saves the state of all your windows when you quit, either through the "Quit" option in the main menu or by using the <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Q" /> shortcut. Upon reopening Zen, all your windows will be restored without tab loss.

## New Blank Window option
You can also create blank windows as an alternative to synced windows. A **New Blank Window** option is available from the main menu, and can be accessed using <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N" /> (keyboard shortcut can be configured from Settings). Blank windows will inherit cookies and container from the origin Space, and sites you visit in blank windows will also be written to your history. 

For example, when you open a blank window from a Space with a Banking container profile, the new blank window will open tabs in the Banking container by default.

When you're done browsing on a blank window, use the "Move To..." button, found above your tab list, to move and synchronize them with an existing Space.

## Recovering Lost Window Sessions

Zen 1.18b introduces a new session backup system alongside the Window Sync feature. This system regularly saves the tab state of all synced windows, including changes to their status (essentials, pinning, split view). This significantly improves the accuracy of session restoration by Zen and facilitates manual restoration if tabs are lost. Follow these steps to restore:

<Callout type="info" title="Look up Root Directory of your Zen profile">
	- In the Flatpak version, the profile root directory is located at `~/.var/app/app.zen_browser.zen/.zen`.
	- Otherwise, for other platforms/versions, you can look it up by opening `about:support` in Zen, navigate to **Applications Basics** section, find **Profile Directory**, and click **Open Directory** button.
</Callout>

- Navigate to the root directory of your Zen profile.
- **Make sure Zen is fully closed.**
- Open the `zen-sessions-backup` folder. You will see multiple backup files in .jsonlz4 format:

- Duplicate the latest zen-sessions-`date-hour`.jsonlz4 file, rename it to **zen-sessions.jsonlz4**.
- Copy **zen-sessions.jsonlz4** to your profile root directory.
- Open Zen again and tabs from the session backup will be restored.

<Callout type="info" title="Can we sync Zen tabs and windows across devices?">
    The current window sync only works on the same device, but multi-device sync support is planned. For now, you can use the **Send to Device** option to send tabs between devices that logged in to the same Mozilla account.
