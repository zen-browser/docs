Zen's Glance lets you preview websites on top of your current tab, without fully switching to it. By default, you can create a Glance view by holding <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt" /> as trigger key when clicking a link in a regular tab. In Essentials and pinned tabs, Glance will be automatically created when clicking a link outside current website, without having to pressing the trigger key.

{
<div align="center">
  <video width="100%" loop autoPlay>
    <source src="/assets/user-manual/glance/glance.webm" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
  </video>
</div>
}

Once Glance appeared, there's three buttons on its top left side:

- Close button to close the view (can also be done by clicking outside the Glance area).
- Expand button to move the website into a new tab.
- Split button to add the website as a split tab.

You can disable/enable Glance and change the trigger method (from <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Alt + Click" /> to <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Ctrl + Click" /> or <KeyboardShortcut shortcut="Shift + Click" />) by opening `Settings` > `Look and Feel` > `Glance`.

With Glance, you can take a quick look of websites, move on if you're done with the site, and go back to your previous surfing activities easily.
